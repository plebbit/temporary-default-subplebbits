A NSFW sub must have at least one of the specific nsfw tags: "adult", "anti", "gore", "vulgar".

Different clients may have different rules for what is considered NSFW.

Specific topic/interest tags (like politics, news, video, music, pics, etc) may be added if enough subs share the specific topic (ie. a category is needed).
