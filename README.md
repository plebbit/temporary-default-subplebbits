# temporary-default-subplebbits

### NOTE: ./subplebbits.json is deprecated, use ./multisub.json instead

Submit a pull request to have your subplebbit added, or contact devs on Telegram [@plebbit](https://t.me/plebbit).

In the future, this process will be automated by submitting proposals to a plebbit DAO, using the [plebbit token](https://etherscan.io/token/0xea81dab2e0ecbc6b5c4172de4c22b6ef6e55bd8f).

>### What is this?
This list is used to show subplebbits by default in our clients' homepages, automatically subscribing all our users to them.

## Requirements to have your subplebbit included
- 99% uptime: your sub must be online 24/7 to appear by default in our clients.
- non-random topic: subplebbits about specific topics are preferred, such as technology, movies, anime, business, etc.
- unique topic: please check if your sub's topic is already taken in our list.
- no self-promotion, unless in partnership: please contact the @plebbit org devs for partnership inquiries.

>### Isn't this list supposed to be decentralized? Why are there requirements to have my sub included?
This list is not mandatory on plebbit itself, which is fully decentralized: nobody can stop a plebbit user from connecting P2P to your subplebbit, if they know its address.

However, the developer of each plebbit client effectively holds veto power over the list, since the list has to be manually implemented in the frontend code of the interface/client. If you don't like how a plebbit client dev implements this list, you are always free to create your own plebbit client, even using your own list.

Our web and desktop clients (Seedit, Plebchan) don't use blacklists. You can use our clients to connect to any specific subplebbit by using its address, whether it's included in this default list or not.

## NSFW Subplebbits

NSFW content is supported, but it might be hidden by default in the client, depending on its target audience.

A NSFW subplebbit must have at least 1 of these 4 NSFW tags: "adult", "anti", "gore", "vulgar".

- "adult" (NSFW): all subs with nudity/pornographic content.
- "anti" (may be considered inappropriate, depending on the client): all subs anti-anything.
- "gore" (NSFW): all subs with graphic violence/gore/war content.
- "vulgar" (may be considered inappropriate, depending on the client): all subs with vulgar content.
